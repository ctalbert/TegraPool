System for checking in and out devices. These devices are stored as an IP address, and can then be checked in and out through a templeton-based server frontend.

Currently using LDAP communication, and a simple MySQL database on the backend.

Based off gofaster dashboard as a templeton example, so there are some cases where that is used.
