Welcome to the Tegra Pool VM.

This machine controls the access to the tegra pool and maintains the database
that keeps track of the status of the machines available for checkout from the
tegra pool.

= To Add a New Device To the Pool =
1. Create a new user account for the device on this machine:
1a. Set the username to something simple, like "deviceX" where "device" is the type of 
    device and X is the number of those devices in the pool.
1b. Set the password of this user account to 'giveMEtegra' (no quotes)
2. Ensure the device has the SUTAgent running on it and that it is installed
3. Run /home/mozauto/add_new_device.py:
3a. python add_new_device.py --ip=<ip address of device> --user=<user you created in step 1>
3b. Reboot the device and it will automatically register and add itself into the pool

= Services running by default =
* /home/mozauto/TegraPool/server/portWatcher.py - this is what listens for new devices upon reboot
            it ensures that the devices are registered in the database and have the proper state.
* /home/mozauto/TegraPool/server/server.py - this runs the website that users can interact with
            the system.  To run it with port 80: python server.py 80

= To Deploy a New System =
* Put the startupfiles on the root of the main user of the box
* Put the html and server directories into a "TegraPool" directory
* Copy the .conf scripts into /etc/init
* ensure the start_* scripts are exectuable (and their paths in the conf scripts are correct)
* install templeton (https://github.com/markrcote/templeton) into your python path
* install the android-sdk and ensure that adb (<android-sdk-dir>/platform-tools/adb) is on
  the path for all users
* create a dbsettings.ini file in the TegraPool/server directory.  It should have the
  form:
[database]
MYSQL_SERVER = <mysql host>
MYSQL_USER = <mysql user for tegrapool>
MYSQL_PASSWD = <mysql passwd for tegrapool>
MYSQL_DB = <mysql db for tegrapool>

Once you have this file you can run TegraPool/server/createDB.py to create your database.

= Security =
This system is inherently unsecure (if you read this readme you know how to ssh into the box for
goodness sake).  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS ON A WEB ACCESSIBLE SYSTEM.  Only deploy this on a system protected
behind a strong firewall.
